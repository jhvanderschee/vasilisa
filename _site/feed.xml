        <title>Trinket</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A little trinket stuck high up on a shelf, &lt;br /&gt;
unnoticed by passerbys.&lt;br /&gt;
A little trinket,  full of little gears &lt;br /&gt;
forming a labryinth &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ lab-uh-rinth ]
    
    noun:
        1. an intricate combination of paths or passages in which
        it is difficult to find one's way or to reach the exit.
        2. a maze of paths bordered by high hedges, as in a park or 
        garden, for the amusement of those who search for a way out.
        3. a complicated or tortuous arrangement.
        4. any confusingly intricate state of things or events; 
        a bewildering complex:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with little spines&lt;br /&gt;
folding together in synchrony,&lt;br /&gt;
spinning pointlessly away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Long Will I Love You</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How long will I love you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as stars are above you&lt;br /&gt;
And longer, if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I need you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as the seasons need to&lt;br /&gt;
Follow their plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I be with you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as the sea is bound to&lt;br /&gt;
Wash upon the sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I want you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you want me to&lt;br /&gt;
And longer by far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I hold you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as your father told you,&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I give to you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as I live through you&lt;br /&gt;
However long you say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will I love you?&lt;br /&gt;
As long as stars are above you&lt;br /&gt;
And longer, if I may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all traveling through time together&lt;br /&gt;
Every day of our lives.&lt;br /&gt;
All we can do is do our best&lt;br /&gt;
To relish this remarkable ride.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Broken Ones</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross your heart and say you’ve never given up&lt;br /&gt;
That you carried on when every door was shut&lt;br /&gt;
That you live, you live with no regret!&lt;br /&gt;
We wear a smile to hide that we’ve been hurt before&lt;br /&gt;
Keep our disasters in a suitcase by the door,&lt;br /&gt;
‘Cause you know, you know we’re only human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lay your hands on the left behind&lt;br /&gt;
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,&lt;br /&gt;
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!&lt;br /&gt;
Love the broken ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raise your glass to all the words we never say&lt;br /&gt;
We do our best, but still we look the other way,&lt;br /&gt;
‘Cause sometimes it’s easier to run&lt;br /&gt;
‘Cause after all, we’re only human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lay your hands on the left behind&lt;br /&gt;
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,&lt;br /&gt;
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!&lt;br /&gt;
Love the broken ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we’re left behind,&lt;br /&gt;
Feel like the only one,&lt;br /&gt;
But we were born to try&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, we’re only human!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lay your hand on the left behind&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, we all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while&lt;br /&gt;
In a crowded place trying not to feel so alone,&lt;br /&gt;
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!&lt;br /&gt;
So let’s love the broken ones, whoa-oh&lt;br /&gt;
Love the broken ones, no no&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s love the broken ones, whoa oh whoa oh&lt;br /&gt;
Love the broken ones, yeah-yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s love the broken ones!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conversations In The Dark</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Talk&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s have conversations in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
World asleep and I’m awake with you&lt;br /&gt;
With you&lt;br /&gt;
Watch&lt;br /&gt;
Movies that we’ve both already seen&lt;br /&gt;
I ain’t even looking at the screen, it’s true&lt;br /&gt;
I got my eyes on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you say that you’re not worthy&lt;br /&gt;
You get hung up on your flaws&lt;br /&gt;
But in my eyes, you are perfect&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
Swear on everything I pray to&lt;br /&gt;
That I won’t break your heart&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be there when you get lonely, lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me&lt;br /&gt;
And your love is all you owe me&lt;br /&gt;
And I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On&lt;br /&gt;
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I can sleep forever next to you&lt;br /&gt;
Next to you&lt;br /&gt;
And we&lt;br /&gt;
We got places we both gotta be&lt;br /&gt;
But there ain’t nothing I would rather do&lt;br /&gt;
Than blow off all my plans for you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you say that you’re not worthy&lt;br /&gt;
And get hung up on your flaws&lt;br /&gt;
But, in my eyes, you are perfect&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;br /&gt;
As you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
Swear on everything I pray to&lt;br /&gt;
That I won’t break your heart&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be there when you get lonely, lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me&lt;br /&gt;
And your love is all you owe me&lt;br /&gt;
And I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When no one seems to notice&lt;br /&gt;
And your days, they seem so hard&lt;br /&gt;
My darling, you should know this&lt;br /&gt;
My love is everywhere you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t ever try to change you, change you&lt;br /&gt;
I will always want the same you, same you&lt;br /&gt;
Swear on everything I pray to&lt;br /&gt;
That I won’t break your heart&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be there when you get lonely, lonely&lt;br /&gt;
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me&lt;br /&gt;
And your love is all you owe me&lt;br /&gt;
And I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t break your heart&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wicked Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's strange what desire will make foolish people do*&lt;br /&gt;
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you&lt;br /&gt;
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you&lt;br /&gt;
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
With you&lt;br /&gt;
With you&lt;br /&gt;
(This world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way&lt;br /&gt;
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you&lt;br /&gt;
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way&lt;br /&gt;
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you&lt;br /&gt;
And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
With you&lt;br /&gt;
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you&lt;br /&gt;
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do&lt;br /&gt;
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you&lt;br /&gt;
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you&lt;br /&gt;
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
With you (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you&lt;br /&gt;
(This world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
No, I (this world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
(This world is only gonna break your heart)&lt;br /&gt;
Nobody loves no one&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
